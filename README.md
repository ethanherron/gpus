# gpus

this is a workplace for learning/practicing using gpus

i have a dir with notes and exercises for textbooks. Right now I'm going through Programming Massively Parallel Processors. I made an entire dir for textbooks because I think I'll need to go through one more to really get a good feel for gpus, but we'll see.

Then I have a dir 'kernel-a-day' where I'm writing a kernel everyday. I may not populate that if I write one for an exercise in the book, but that's the general goal - time on feet/time on gpu. unfortunately I think thats the only way there is.
